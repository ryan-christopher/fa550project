                        for teaching. Throughout this semester I have run activities with 4th through 8th graders
                        showing them the basics of coding and music, as well as how they can be combined. <br>
                        I was recently tasked with creating my own programming/activites where the youth can
                        learn about music through coding, and have put together three projects.

                        to teach this is through taking sound samples, and using loops to repeat them. Often
                        our favorite songs use loops of 4, 8, or 16 measures which can be programmed surprisingly
                        easily with the right tools.
